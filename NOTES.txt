I'm currently working on the e1 e2 .. en term optimiztion and in order
to get the most dakka, the algorithm is pretty tricky

I need to iterate backwards over the terminators in order to get the
biggest possible scan forward.

For each terminator, I need to try all possible proceeding lists
of instructions and then resume the compilation.

Basically I need to spend more time separating my analysis out
from my compilation stuff.

The thing I'm iterating on right now is making sure that
a*terma*term still compiles to a couple of scan instructions.
