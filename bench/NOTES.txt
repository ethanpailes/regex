I can probably do this in much fewer LOC by just modifying
the exiting compiler and pikevm to also be able to handle
skips.

  Char, Ranges and whatnot get two new fields
    skip: usize
    skip_goto: usize

  The pikevm can be run in skip mode which uses those two
  new fields. I need to do some trait magic to avoid introducing
  performance regressions from unknown calls.
